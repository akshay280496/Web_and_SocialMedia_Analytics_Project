## Problem Statement
A dataset of Shark Tank episodes is made available. It contains 495 entrepreneurs making their pitch to the VC sharks.
You will ONLY use “Description” column for the initial text mining exercise.
Step 1:
Extract the text into text corpus and perform following operations:
Create Document Text Matrix
Use “Deal” as a Dependent Variable
Use CART model and arrive at your CART diagram
Build Logistic Regression Model and find out your accuracy of the model
Build randomForst model and arrive at your varImpPlot
Step 2:
Now, add a variable to you analysis called as “ratio”. This variable is “askedfor/valuation”. (This variable is to be added as a column to your dataframe in Step 1.)
Rebuild “New” models- CART, randomForest and Logistic Regression
